this repo is about me learning deep learning through pytorch 
day 1 = learned about what and where pytorch is used and also about tensors and also multi dimensions such as scalar vector and matrix. 
day 2 - learned about matrix manipulation and how to reshape and stack and resqueeze. 
day 3 = did data preprocessing for the first model
